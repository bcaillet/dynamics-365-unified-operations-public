[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Finance and Operation application, Finance, Commerce and Supply Chain, is available in France Azure region This deployment option serves customers in regulated industry and commercial organizations that do business with entities in France that require local data residency. 

The deployment of the Dynamics 365 services in France is built upon the foundational principles of security, privacy, compliance, transparency and reliability. This deployment provides French organizations a complete cloud infrastructure and platform, and familiar productivity and business application tools.
